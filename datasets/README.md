## Data Preparing
- You are required to prepare a cellular dataset.
* The data folder is named ./datasets/username/image_type, which comprises training images of brightfield, Actin, and DNA, as well as test images of brightfield. Each field of view consists of 5 layers of images collected at different depths. The details are as follows:
```bash
  .datasets
  ├── username
  |     ├── bright
  |     |     └── *.png
  |     └── actin
  |     |     └── *.png
  |     └── dna
  |     |     └── *.png
  |     └── test_bright
  |           └── *.png
          
```
